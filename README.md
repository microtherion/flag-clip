# Flag Clip (Revised)

Hybrid clip / carabiner 3D printable model to attach flags to the cable of a flag pole.

The gate of the carabiner does double duty as the lever of the clip.

Spring mechanism inspired by [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1212828/remixes](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1212828/remixes)

Since this was intended for outdoors use, I've printed this in PETG.

OpenSCAD file enclosed for tuning. In particular, the diameter of the eye at the bottom needs to be closely matched to the flag cable diameter.

## Revision History

### 2022-05-15 Version 1.0	

Initial Design

### 2022-07-04 Version 2.0

Substantial Revision. It turns out that even a moderate wind was enough to pull the flag off the pole with the initial design. This revision is considerably more robust to wind, though it still failed in a heavy thunderstorm.

### 2023-08-15 Version 4.0

Revised again (Rev v3 was unsuccessful). This time tested through an entire season's worth of storms.
